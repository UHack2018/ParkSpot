# ParkSpot

Introduction

Smartphones have attracted increasing attentions from both academic and industrial communities. It can be deployed in various kinds of environments to monitor and collect information. This paper aimed at developing a smart parking system that is more cost effective and user friendly than the already existing systems. The first phase aims at making parking places detectable through the use of sensors present in smartphones, while the second phase aims at communicating the collected data to the user remotely. This is a two-way user system. 


Problem

India is a country which is not only rich in population but also vehicles. And as we know still India is a under developing country the roads are not that good and big, availability of parking space is also very less. People generally park their vehicles in the side of the road which results in high traffic and congestion. And if there’s a parking place near by then also people won’t know about it and won’t bother to park their vehicles in any parking space.


Solution

The idea is to develop a easy and fast way to get a parking place for your vehicle and keep the roads clean and keep your vehicle safe. There will be two different users in this app. One who will mark their parking spaces available for parking and the other one who will get notified about all the free parking spaces available near them. The people who will mark their spaces for parking can be the govt or general public. Govt parking as well as private parking spaces all can be made visible and people passing nearby can use the app and get Enroute to the nearest free parking space. General public also can use this app, if they have free parking place or their parking place remains empty during office hours, using our app they can make use of their parking space and even earn some money beyond it they will contribute in keeping the roads clean n traffic low.
And the person who want to park their vehicles in a safe place can use the app and get information about all the free parking spaces near by will all the details like parking charge per hour, safety protocols, distance. And accordingly the driver can choose the best parking space and park their vehicle.
